      # How to Debug Websites on Mobile Safari (iPhone & iPad) Using Web
      Inspector on Mac


      If you’ve ever built a website, you know how tricky it can be to make sure it works perfectly on **iPhones and iPads**. What looks flawless on desktop might look broken on mobile Safari. That’s why learning how to **debug Safari on iPhone or iPad using Web Inspector** is a must for developers, designers, and testers.


      In this guide, we’ll walk through **step-by-step instructions** to enable Safari’s Web Inspector, connect your iOS device to your Mac, and debug websites in real time.


      ## Why Debugging on Mobile Safari Matters


      Safari is the default browser on iOS, and it comes with its quirks. Responsive layouts, touch events, and performance issues can appear only on iPhones or iPads. Using the **Inspect Element tool for mobile Safari** ensures you catch bugs early and deliver a smooth mobile experience.


      ## Step 1: Enable Web Inspector on Your iPhone or iPad


      To get started, you need to turn on Safari’s hidden developer tool:


      1. Open **Settings** on your iOS device.

      2. Scroll down and tap **Safari**.

      3. Tap **Advanced** (bottom of the menu).

      4. Switch on **Web Inspector**.


      Without this step, your Mac won’t be able to connect to your iPhone’s Safari browser.


      ## Step 2: Connect Your iPhone or iPad to Your Mac


      1.


      ## Step 3: Turn On the Develop Menu in Safari on Mac


      By default, Safari hides the Develop menu. To enable it:


      1.


      Now you’ll see a new **Develop** option in Safari’s top navigation.


      ## Step 4: Inspect and Debug Mobile Safari Tabs


      1.


      The **Web Inspector window** will appear, showing:


      1.


      Any edits you make reflect **live on your iPhone/iPad screen**.


      ## Step 5: Troubleshoot and Optimize in Real Time


      Once inside the Safari Web Inspector, you can:


      1.


      This workflow saves tons of time compared to guessing or blindly pushing changes.


      ## Bonus: Debug Mobile Safari Without a Cable


      If you prefer **wireless debugging**, pair your iPhone/iPad with Xcode once. After that, your device will appear in Safari’s **Develop menu** over Wi-Fi.


      ## Conclusion


      Learning how to **inspect element on iPhone Safari** using a Mac is one of the most useful debugging skills for web developers. With Safari’s Web Inspector, you can identify layout bugs, fix JavaScript errors, and optimize performance **directly on mobile Safari** — ensuring your website looks and works great for every iOS user.
